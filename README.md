practice CSS properties and feature branching

simple feature branch workflow:

git pull (to insure I have the latest updates)

git checkout -b feature/{branch-name}

edit and stage/commit as normal.

git push origin {feature/branch-name}

resolve pull request in repository.

delete branch if you want (be careful)
